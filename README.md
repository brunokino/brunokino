### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I currently hold a management position, but as a hobby I really love studying and testing different types of technologies and software architectures.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, Java, NestJS and Apache Kafka
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects
